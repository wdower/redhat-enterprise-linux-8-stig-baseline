logon attempts occur."
  desc  "By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of
unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as
brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    In RHEL 8.2 the \"/etc/security/faillock.conf\" file was incorporated to
centralize the configuration of the pam_faillock.so module.  Also introduced is
a \"local_users_only\" option that will only track failed user authentication
attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP,
etc.) users to allow the centralized platform to solely manage user lockout.

    From \"faillock.conf\" man pages: Note that the default directory that
\"pam_faillock\" uses is usually cleared on system boot so the access will be
reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable a different tally
directory must be set with the \"dir\" option.

    Check that the system locks an account after three unsuccessful logon
attempts with the following commands:

    Note: This check applies to RHEL versions 8.2 or newer, if the system is
RHEL version 8.0 or 8.1, this check is not applicable.

    Verify the pam_faillock.so module is present in the
\"/etc/pam.d/system-auth\" and \" /etc/pam.d/password-auth\" files:

    $ sudo grep pam_faillock.so /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/password-auth

    /etc/pam.d/system-auth:auth               required
           pam_faillock.so preauth
    /etc/pam.d/system-auth:auth               required
           pam_faillock.so authfail
    /etc/pam.d/system-auth:account        required
       pam_faillock.so
    /etc/pam.d/password-auth:auth          required
        pam_faillock.so preauth
    /etc/pam.d/password-auth:auth          required
        pam_faillock.so authfail
    /etc/pam.d/password-auth:account   required
    pam_faillock.so preauth

    If the pam_failllock.so module is not present in the
\"/etc/pam.d/system-auth\" and \" /etc/pam.d/password-auth\" files, this is a
finding.

    Verify the \"/etc/security/faillock.conf\" file is configured to lock an
account after three unsuccessful logon attempts:

    $ sudo grep 'deny =' /etc/security/faillock.conf

    deny = 3

    If the \"deny\" option is not set to \"3\" or less (but not \"0\"), is
missing or commented out, this is a finding.
